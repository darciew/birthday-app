# Birthday App

---------------

## Task

Build a simple web app with a form using an MVC framework that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

- Wish the user happy birthday.
- Tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday.
